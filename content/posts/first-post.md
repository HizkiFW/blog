So yeah, just started making this blog thing. Hosting it in GitHub is nice, since it's free and I get to use Markdown!

Actually the main reason is so that my contribution boxes will look a little more lively, heh. I'll probably make a bunch of blog posts and publish them every other day just to fill it up.

Anyways, I don't really have anything much to say for this one. I'll probably just make another post about how I deployed this blog with Travis. Maybe.

Well then, see you on the next post~!
