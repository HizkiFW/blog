Back at the start of 2017, I was still blind to open-source development. I didn't even use version control for any of my projects, and I always deployed to production directly. In fact, most of my web development was done by directly editing the files via FTP. All of my projects are close-sourced, and I didn't use any open source libraries. Instead, I re-implemented the things I need. However, when I was introduced to open-source development, it completely changed my point of view. Here's a short story of how I got to where I am now.

Last march, my school informed me about a competition called [OSN (Olimpiade Sains Nasional)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia_National_Science_Olympiad). It also included competitive programming, so I immediately accepted it and got regiestered. I love programming, but didn't know anything about doing it competitively. It turns out to be, well, more competitive than I'm comfortable with. We had to memorize a bunch of algorithms, and we also had to write code as fast as we could to beat the time limit. It doesn't give me any time to solve those problems myself, so the only way to win is by memorizing all the different types of questions and the answers to them.

I passed the city-level selection, but was unable to proceed due to the schedule conflicting with one of the IGCSE exams. I chose IGCSE anyways, and in the end didn't regret my choice (got an A* for English).

Although I didn't go that far in OSN, I did meet some interesting people and made a few connections. One of them happens to be [@yukiisbored](https://github.com/yukiisbored), last year's [Google Code-In](https://g.co/gci) winner. That was the first time I've heard about a competition hosted by Google, so I immediately looked it up. I was quite surprised to find that he's one of the three Grand Prize Winners from Indonesia. I talked to him about it and he gave me some information. It's going to be in November, so I placed a reminder lest I forget about it.

A few months later, in August, [@yukiisbored](https://github.com/yukiisbored) invited me as an early-access participant for [Besut Kode](http://besutko.de), a program where they guide and prepare students for GCI. This is where most of the learning happens. There I found out that [@yukiisbored](https://github.com/yukiisbored), while still attending school, is also hired due to his outstanding GitHub activity and his contributions on the open-source world. We were all amazed, and so we strived to follow his footsteps.

Another month passed by, we were alerted of another competition called [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). We only need to make 4 pull requests to any GitHub repository to win a free t-shirt. Well, I made 8. Pictures coming soon!

After that one's done, we all started to seriously prepare for GCI. We finished Besut Kode, and even got some nice merch!

I'm currently still doing GCI, so I'll make another post detailing my adventures there next time.
