      <description>Over the past month or so, I&amp;rsquo;ve been participating in an online programming competition called Google Code-In. The competition features 25 organizations, each of which has their own set of tasks for the students to complete. Out of all of them, I chose OpenWISP. It was initially a random choice, since I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know which one to join, but I eventually stuck with them because of the really warm and supportive community.</description>

      <description>Aw yeah, another blog post! I was actually writing a post about open source competitions, but I moved that aside in favour of this one. Introducing OpenWISP2.
What&amp;rsquo;s OpenWISP2? In short, it&amp;rsquo;s a set of tools to help create and manage networking devices. It might seem a bit boring at first. Why do I need to use more software just to control my network? you may ask. Well, OpenWISP might not prove useful for a network made of a single router and a few nodes, but once your network scales to tens or even hundreds of routers and devices, it&amp;rsquo;ll be a hassle configuring and fixing things if something goes wrong, or if you simply want to change a setting and apply it to all the devices.</description>
